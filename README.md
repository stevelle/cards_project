# stevelle/cards_project
Model project for playing with frameworks and patterns

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevelle/cards_project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stevelle/cards_project)

This project is an experimental / model repository intended to test a selection of
frameworks and development and design patterns: 

### Frameworks and Libraries
 - The [Falcon](https://falconframework.org) REST API framework and several
related plugins are featured. 
 - Unit tests are built on [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org).


#### Development and Design Patterns
 - Some consideration is given to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and some
   to the model of Microservices.
 - The project is organized as a [monorepo](https://danluu.com/monorepo/).
   Sub-projects contained in this repo are each [listed below](README.md/#sub-projects).
 - Some aspects of the Architecture will experimentally explore the use of 
   [Command Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS)](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)
   to provide transactional integrity and view isolation to the complex
   changes expected in exercising the data models.

#### Unresolved concerns
 - API versioning
 - API discoverability
 - API Authc/Authz
 - API Caching

## Deploying
This project is just getting started. There is no deployment support, no model
chosen, and no appropriate tooling is provided at this time. 

### Local execution
For now the following command will start the card_table service

  `$ gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 card_table.server`

when working in an environment where the python 3 requirements have been met.

### Docker execution
Build the container
`docker build . -t card_deck`

Run the container
`docker run -d -p 8000:8000 card_deck`


## Contributing
I thank you for your interest, but contributions are not invited at this time.
